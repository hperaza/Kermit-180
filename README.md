# KERMIT for RSX180 and RSX280
Here you can find the CP/M Kermit-80 ported to the RSX180/280 OS.

Kermit-180 has been tested on a P112 (Z180) machine running RSX180 and on a Z280RC (Z280) machine running RSX280.

## Quick start guide
1. Start Kermit at the PC side and setup it accordingly, the following settings were used with C-Kermit 9.0.302 under Linux:  
`set line /dev/ttyUSB1`   (or whatever line your machine is connected to)  
`set speed 19200` (this is the default for the Z280RC quad-serial board under RSX280)  
`set attributes off`  
`set parity space` (or `set parity none`)  
`set file type binary`  
`set carrier-watch off`  
`set flow-control none`  
`set control-character prefixed all`  
`set file patterns off`  
`set transfer mode manual`  
To avoid having to type the above commands every time, you can save them into a text file and then use the Kermit's `take` command to execute them.

2. Start Kermit-180 on the RSX180/280 side:  
`run $kermit` (if Kermit-180 is not installed)  
`ker` (if Kermit-180 is installed as ...KER)  
Once it is running, setup the communication parameters. The following settings were used on a Z280RC running RSX280:  
`set line tt3:` (or whatever line the Z280RC is connected to the PC)  
`set parity space` (or `set parity none`, but must match the PC settings above)  
`set file-mode binary`  
As with the PC Kermit, you can save the above command sequence into a text file for later execution via the `take` command. If you name the file `kermit.ini` and place it into your user's directory, Kermit-180 will execute it automatically on startup.

4. You can now use the `send` command on the PC side and the `get` command on the RSX280 side to transfer a file from the PC to the Z280RC. Do the opposite to send a file from the Z280RC to the PC.

5. Best is just to put the PC Kermit in `server` mode. Then, you can send and receive files by only entering commands at RSX180/280 terminal. E.g.  
`send examp.cmd` to send a file to the PC  
`get kermit.tsk` to fetch a file from the PC  
`remote dir` to browse the PC directory  
`dir` to browse the local RSX180/280 directory  
etc.

## Bugs and Limitations
At the moment, Kermit-180 is not able to communicate with a remote machine using the same terminal line the program was invoked from (i.e. `set line ti:` won't work.) That's not a big problem since machines running RSX180 or RSX280 usually have access to more than one terminal. Using a separate communication line is even desired, as it allows you to monitor and control the file transfer from the login terminal.

Also, the current version of Kermit-180 is built by default as a privileged task, as it needs to set the characteristics of the terminal used for communications to *slave* with *echo disabled,* and those are privileged operations for terminals other than the user's current one. This has the undesirable side effect that Kermit-180 can access any file in the system, and in any directory, regardless of the current user privileges. That is not a problem as long as Kermit-180 is not *INS*talled, since only privileged users can run a privileged task.

The filename completion (e.g. for DIR or ERA commands) is not working fully correctly yet: pressing ESC or TAB a second time appends part of the file extension again to the completed file name, etc.

When using C-Kermit 9.0 on Linux, a file transfer from the PC to the Z280RC sometimes stalls and then aborts with a "Too many retries" error. Usually restarting the transfer fixes the problem, but it can get stubborn stopping at approximately the same spot over and over. The older C-Kermit 5A(190) does not show the problem.

**Update:** the problem was traced back to C-Kermit taking certain liberties with
the Kermit protocol: specifically, not prefixing all control characters like it
should.  The `set control-character prefixed all` fixes the problem.  Also,
I'd recommend to use `set file patterns off` and `set transfer mode manual`
as well, otherwise C-Kermit will try to switch automatically to ascii mode
when transferring text files in binary mode without Kermit-180 being aware of
the change. The result is a text file with duplicated carriage return characters
being received at the RSX180/280 side if the file at the PC side already had
CR/LF line endings.

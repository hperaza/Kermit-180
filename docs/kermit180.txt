1.1. Credits

Kermit-180 is derivated from on CP/M Kermit which, in turn, is the first of
all the Kermit programs.  CP/M Kermit was originally written by Bill
Catchings of Columbia University in 1981.  Over the years, contributions
have been added by many people, including Charles Carvalho (ACC), Bernie
Eiben (DEC), Nick Bush (Stevens Institute of Technology), John Bray
(University of Tennessee), Bruce Tanner (Cerritos College), Greg Small
(University of California at Berkeley), Kimmo Laaksonen (Helskini University
of Technology), Bertil Schou (Loughborough University), Jon Warbrick
(Plymouth Polytechnic University), Brian Robertson (Aberdeen University),
A.J.  Cole (Leeds University), John Shearwood (Birmingham University), Tony
Addyman (Salford University), Godfrey Nix and Martin Carter (Nottingham
University), Ian Young (Edinburgh University), Chris Miles (Manchester
University), Richard Russell, Dave Roberts, and many, many others.

The latest know CP/M Kermit Version is 4.11, which is the work of Mike
Freeman of the Bonneville Power Administration in Vancouver, WA, USA, with
assistance from Russell Lang of Monash University in Australia, Jay S Rouman
of Mt Pleasant MI, and others.

The current Kermit Version 4.12 is the work of Hector Peraza.

This document is based on the original Kermit-80 documentation written by C. 
Gianone, Columbia University Center for Computing Activities New York, NY
10027, on April 23, 1991.

1.3. Differences with Kermit-80

Kermit-180 is compatible with Kermit-80 at command level, except for a few
exceptions:

   - SET DIRECTORY-LISTING {LONG/BRIEF} replaces SET DIRECTORY-FILE-SIZE
     {ON/OFF} command. The long directory listing displays file sizes,
     attributes and creation date using a format similar to RSX180/280's
     PIP command.

   - SET COLLISION {DISCARD/OVERWRITE/NEW-VERSION}. The BACKUP option was
     removed, since RSX180/280 automatically creates a new version of an
     existing file, keeping the old one.  The RENAME option was changed
     to NEW-VERSION and makes sense only when transferring files from
     a system that supports file versions (e.g. RSX-11M, VMS, or another
     RSX180 or RSX280 system) and the file being transferred has the same
     name, type and version number as a file on the local machine.

   - CD command to change current device and directory, replaces CP/M's
     SET DEFAULT-DISK and SET USER commands.

   - The current device and directory are displayed in the prompt.

   - Argument to SET BUFFER-SIZE command is the number of 512-byte blocks,
     instead of 128-byte sectors.

   - SET LINE added as synonym for SET PORT for those used to Kermit-11.

   - DELETE added as synonym for the ERASE command.

   - Added @ as synonym for TAKE command, for compatibility with RSX180/280
     conventions.

   - TAB autocompletes keyword like ESC does (for compatibility with modern
     Linux/Windows conventions.)

   - Precise PAUSE timing using the system timer services.

In addition, Kermit-180 implements Remote and Server modes.


2. Overview of Kermit Operation

Use the SET command to establish necessary communication parameters like
PORT, SPEED, and PARITY.  Use the CONNECT to establish a terminal connection
to the remote computer.  If you are dialing out with a modem, type the
necessary dialing commands to the modem first.  The dialing process can be
automated to some extent using a TAKE command file containing INPUT, OUTPUT,
and PAUSE commands.  Then log in to the remote computer or service and
conduct a session.

To transfer a text file, start the Kermit program on the remote computer and
tell it to SEND the desired file (if uploading) or to RECEIVE (if
downloading).  "Escape back" to Kermit-180, usually by typing Ctrl-\ C (hold
down the Control key and press the backslash key, and then type the letter
C.) At the Kermit-180 prompt type RECEIVE (if you gave a SEND command to the
remote Kermit) or SEND filename (if you gave a receive command to the remote
Kermit).

To transfer a binary file, give the command SET FILE TYPE BINARY to the remote
Kermit and SET FILE-MODE BINARY to Kermit-180 before issuing any SEND or
RECEIVE commands.

Multiple files of the same type (text or binary) can be transferred in a single
operation using "wildcard notation" (including special characters like asterisk
in the filename).

When file transfer is complete, CONNECT back to the remote computer, use the
EXIT command to exit from the remote Kermit program, finish your work on the
remote computer, log out from it, escape back to Kermit-180 again, and EXIT
from Kermit-180.

The remote Kermit may also be put into "server mode" to simplify these
operations.  Give the SERVER command to the remote Kermit, escape back to
Kermit-180, and then issue SEND commands to send files (upload), GET filename
commands to receive (download) files, REMOTE commands to request various other
services (like directory listings) from the remote Kermit.  When you are done,
give a BYE command to terminate your remote session, or a FINISH command to
tell the remote Kermit to return to its prompt so you can CONNECT back and
conduct further business.

The opposite is also possible: Kermit-180 may also be put into "server mode"
and GET and SEND commands issued from the remote Kermit. This simplifies
operation with remote computers whose Kermit does not implement the SERVER
command.

That's all there is to it.


2.1. Kermit-180 Description

Kermit-180 is able to run in both "remote" and "local" modes.  It includes a
terminal emulator for establishing a connection to a remote computer or
service, and during file transfer in "local" mode it keeps the screen
updated with the file name and the packet number, whether sending or
receiving.

Kermit-180 is capable of precise timeouts on an input request, and can break
deadlocks automatically.  If, despite the timeout capability, the transmission
appears to be stuck (and you can tell that this has happened if the screen
fails to change for a while) you can type carriage return to have the micro
do what it would have done on a timeout, namely NAK the expected packet to
cause the foreign host to send it again (or, if the micro is sending, to
retransmit the last packet).  Micro/micro or micro/IBM-mainframe transfers
could require this kind of manual intervention.

File transfers may be interrupted in several ways.

Control-C       This will return you to Kermit-180 command level immediately,
                so that you can connect back to the remote system, or take any
                other desired action.

Control-X       When sending a file, this will terminate the sending of the
                current file with a signal to the Kermit on the other side to
                discard what it got so far.  If there are more files to be
                sent, Kermit-180 will go on to the next one.  When receiving a
                file, Kermit-180 will send a signal to the remote Kermit to stop
                sending this file.  If the remote Kermit understands this
                signal (not all implementations of Kermit do), it will comply,
                otherwise the file will keep coming.  In any case, the remote
                Kermit will go on to the next file in the group, if any.

Control-Z       Like Control-X, except if a file group is being transmitted,
                this will stop the transmission of the entire group.  If only a
                single file is being transmitted, it works exactly like
                Control-X.

Carriage Return If you type a carriage return Kermit-180 will resend the current
                packet.  You may do this repeatedly, up to the packet retry
                limit (somewhere between 5 and 16 times) for a particular
                packet.

2.2. Local and Remote Operation

Kermit-180 by default assumes that all file transfers will occur over the
terminal line that you are currently logged in on (TI:).  This is known as
REMOTE mode (the RSX180/280 is the remote system).  This would be the
desired case if you are running Kermit on a microcomputer such as a PC and
are currently logged into the RSX180/280 system through the micro.  However,
if you wanted to dial out, say by an autodial modem, from RSX180/280 to
another system, you need to tell Kermit-180 to use some other terminal line. 
This would be called LOCAL mode (the RSX180/280 is the local system).  The
line can be altered with the SET PORT or SET LINE command (see section on
SET and CONNECT).

On RSX180/280, privilege is required to alter settings on any other terminal
line unless the line is set Public via the MCR SET /PUB command.


2.3. Kermit-180 Commands

Kermit-180 is an interactive program.  It issues a prompt, you type a command.
The process repeats until you give the EXIT command to leave the program.

Commands consist of keywords, filenames, and numbers.  Keywords may be
abbreviated to minimum unique length.  "?" may be typed to request a menu of
the available options for the current field at any point in a command.  ESC may
be typed at any point in a command to fill out the current keyword or filename;
if sufficient characters have not been typed to identify the current field
uniquely, Kermit-180 will sound a beep and allow you to continue from that
point.  Here are Kermit-180's commands:

@filespec
        Take characters and commands from the specified file as if they were
        entered from the keyboard.  See the TAKE command for more details.

BREAK   Send a BREAK condition to the remote computer.  This is only possible
        if the terminal driver is capable of sending breaks.  It is intended
        to be used with PAUSE, OUTPUT, etc and the TAKE command to do weird
        and wonderful things, like automatic logging on to a remote host.

BYE     When talking to a remote Kermit Server, this command shuts down the
        server and logs it out, and also exits from Kermit-180 to RSX180/280
        command level.

CD device:[directory]
        This allows you to set the default device and unit and/or the
        directory as destination of file transfers.  In addition, issuing
        this command causes Kermit-180 to switch to the specified device and
        directory.  The colon must be included in the device name, and the
        directory may be enclosed in brackets.  The selected device and
        directory appear in your Kermit-180 prompt, for instance

            Kermit-180 SY0:[USER]>

CONNECT Establish a terminal connection to the computer, service, or device
        that is connected to the serial port, i.e.  pass all typing to the
        serial port and display all input from the serial port on the screen.
        Also, emulate a DEC VT52 to allow cursor control, screen clearing,
        etc., if VT52-EMULATION is ON (see below), in which case you should
        also set your terminal type on the remote host to VT52.  The CONNECT
        command may be abbreviated by the single letter C.

        Warning: VT52 emulation is only successful if your system or its
        attached terminal can do the same sort of functions as a genuine VT52.
        Things to beware of are cursor addressing, clear to end of page and end
        of line, clear screen, home cursor, and clear-and-home functions.  The
        usability of VT52 emulation depends entirely on how many of the VT52
        functions can be emulated by your micro or terminal.

        The escape character differs from micro to micro; when you issue the
        CONNECT command, the micro will print a message telling you how to get
        back.  The escape sequence is generally an uncommonly-used control
        character, like CTRL-backslash or CTRL-rightbracket, followed by a
        single letter "command":

        C   Close Connection, return to Kermit-180 command level.
        S   Display Status of connection, but maintain remote connection.
        ?   List available single-character commands.
        0   (zero) Send a null (0) character.
        B   Send a BREAK signal.  Most systems provide this function.
        P   Toggle printer on or off.  Allows you to copy whatever goes to the
            screen to the printer.
        S   Temporarily suspend logging to the log file.
        Q   Restart logging to the log file
        ^\  (or whatever - a second copy of the escape character) Send the
            escape character itself to the remote host.

COPY source destination
        Copy a named file to another file, either on the same drive or another
        drive.

DELETE filespec
        This command erases the specified file(s).  The names of the files
        being erased are not displayed.  This is the same as the ERASE
        command.

DIRECTORY
        This provides a directory listing of the specified files.  If no
        files are specified, all files on the default disk are listed.  File
        sizes in bytes, file attributes and file creation date are included. 
        You may interrupt the listing at any time by typing Ctrl-C.  The
        listing concludes with a display of the amount of free storage left
        on the disk.  You can inhibit the display of file attributes by SET
        DIRECTORY-LISTING BRIEF.

ERASE filespec
        This command erases the specified file(s).  The names of the files
        being erased are not displayed.  This is the same as the ERASE
        command.

EXIT    Quit back to the system.  QUIT is a synonym for EXIT.

FINISH  Like LOGOUT, but shuts down the remote server without logging it out.
        Leaves you at Kermit-180 command level; subsequent CONNECT commands
        will put you back at host system command level.

GET filespec [local_filespec]
        When Kermit-180 is talking to a Kermit Server on the host, you should
        use the GET command to request the server to send files to you, for
        example:

            get hlp:k*.hlp

        You may specify a local filename if you want to save the remote file
        under a different filename.  Limitation: If you request an alternate
        block check type using the SET BLOCK command, the GET command will not
        communicate it to the remote server.  If you want to have type 2 or 3
        block checks done when getting files from the server, you have to issue
        the appropriate SET BLOCK command to the remote Kermit before putting
        it in server mode.

HELP    List all these commands, with a short description on what the commands
        do.  A question mark will do the same.  If you have already typed a
        command but do not know what the parameters are, type a space (to
        indicate the end of the command) and a question mark.  You will be
        informed of what Kermit can expect at that stage.

INPUT seconds text
        Setup a text line and time delay for the Kermit-180 program to expect
        from the host, then wait up to the given number of seconds for text to
        be sent to your RSX180/280 system.

LOG filespec
        When CONNECTed to a foreign host as a terminal, log the terminal
        session to the specified diskette file.  This functionality depends to
        some extent on the remote host's ability to do XON/XOFF flow control,
        and does not guarantee a complete transcript (after all, that's what
        the Kermit protocol is for).  The log file is closed when the
        connection is closed by typing the escape character followed by the
        single-character command "C".

        It is possible to temporarily suspend logging during connect state.
        Typing an escape sequence can turn file logging on (<escape-character>
        R for Resume) or off (<escape-character> Q for quiet).

        Re-entering connect state will re-open the previously opened log file
        and append to that file.

LOGOUT  Like BYE, but leaves you at Kermit-180 command level.

OUTPUT text
        Send the text to the remote computer as if you had typed it. This
        simply copies the string to the correct line, and assumes all
        appropriate parameters have been set to be used, e.g. speed, parity
        etc.  It is intended for use in TAKE command files.

PAUSE seconds
        If this command is issued, the Kermit-180 program will wait for the
        given number of seconds before proceeding with another command. 
        This is intended for use in TAKE commands, where you may want to
        pause for a while before proceeding with the rest of the TAKE file. 

PRINT   Print a file to the console and printer.  Output to the printer is
        buffered by the Kermit-maintained printer buffer.  This routine is
        identical to TYPE but characters are echoed to the printer as well as
        to the screen.  Suspending and canceling output is as described in
        TYPE.

QUIT    Synonym for EXIT.

RECEIVE filespec
        Receive file(s) from the remote Kermit, and save them under the
        names provided in the file headers supplied by the remote host.  If
        a local filespec is given, the file is saved under the given
        filename.  If the names aren't legal, use as many legal characters
        from the name as possible (see the description of SET FILE-WARNING
        below).  If there's a conflict, and FILE-WARNING is ON, warn the
        user and try to build a unique name for the file by adding "&"
        characters to the name.  RECEIVE can be abbreviated to the single
        letter R.

REMOTE command
        Send a command to a remote Kermit server.  The results are sent back
        to your screen.  When two arguments are required and specify less
        than two in the command, you will be prompted for the missing
        arguments.  REMOTE commands include:

        REMOTE CD [directory]
            Ask the remote server to change its default directory.  If no
            directory is specified, the server changes to its login directory.

        REMOTE COPY file1 file2
            Ask the remote server to copy file1 to file2.

        REMOTE RENAME file1 file2
            Ask the remote server to rename file1 to file2.

        REMOTE DELETE filespec
            Ask the remote server to delete the named file or files.

        REMOTE DIRECTORY [filespec]
            Ask the remote server to display a directory listing of the given
            files or, if the filespec is omitted, all the files in the current
            device or directory.

        REMOTE DISK-USAGE
            Ask the remote server to display information about its disk usage
            (such as free or used space).

        REMOTE ERASE filespec
            Same as REMOTE DELETE.

        REMOTE FINISH
            Same as FINISH.

        REMOTE HELP
            Ask the remote server to display a list of the commands it can
            respond to.

        REMOTE HOST command
            Ask the remote server to have its operating system execute the
            given command.

        REMOTE KERMIT command
            Ask the remote server to execute the given Kermit command, given in
            the server Kermit's command syntax.

        REMOTE LOGIN user password
            Log in to a remote Kermit server which has been set up to require a
            username and password.

        REMOTE MESSAGE text
            Send the text to the remote server for display on its screen
            (useful with MS-DOS Kermit servers).

        REMOTE SET parameter value
            Ask the remote server to set the given parameter to the given
            value, for example REMOTE SET FILE TYPE BINARY.  Type REMOTE SET ?
            to see a list of the REMOTE SET options.

        REMOTE SPACE
            Same as REMOTE DISK-USAGE.

        REMOTE STATUS
            Ask the remote server to provide a status report.

        REMOTE TYPE file
            Ask the remote server to display the named file on the micro's
            screen.

        REMOTE WHO [user]
            Ask the remote server for a list of users who are logged in, or if
            a user is specified, for a report on the named user.

RENAME file1 file2
        Rename local RSX180/280 file1 to file2.

SEND filespec
        Send file(s) specified by filespec to the remote Kermit.  The
        filespec may contain RSX180/280 wildcards.  SEND may be abbreviated
        to the single letter S.

SERVER
        Puts  a  remote  Kermit-180  in  "server mode", so that it receives
        all further commands in packets from the local Kermit. The Kermit-180
        server is capable (as of this writing) of executing the remote server
        commands listed below. Any nonstandard parameters should be selected
        with SET commands before putting Kermit-180 into server mode, in
        particular the file type.

        SEND filespec
                Send file(s) specified by filespec to the remote Kermit-180
                server.

        GET filespec [local_filespec]
                Requests the remote Kermit-180 server to send files to the
                Local machine.

        FINISH
                Tells the remote Kermit server to exit without logging out
                of the remote system.  You can then CONNECT back to the
                remote Kermit program.

        REMOTE DIRECTORY [filespec]
                The names of the files that match the given file specification
                will be displayed on your screen, perhaps along with size and
                date information for each file.  If no file specification is
                given, all files from the current directory will be listed.

        REMOTE CWD [directory]
                Change Working Directory.  If no directory name is provided,
                the server will change to the default or home directory. 
                The directory specification may be preceded by a device name.

        REMOTE SPACE
                Display information about disk usage in the current device.

SET parameter [value]
        Set the specified parameter to the specified value.  Possible
        parameter settings:

        AUTORECEIVE ON (or OFF)
                Allows several files to be received without having to type
                RECEIVE on the receiving machine.  The routine simply looks
                for activity on the serial line, and if so fudges a RECEIVE
                command.  The packet sent by the sender will be lost.

        BLOCK-CHECK-TYPE option
                The options are:

                1-CHARACTER-CHECKSUM
                        Normal, default, standard 6-bit checksum.
                2-CHARACTER-CHECKSUM
                        A 12-bit checksum encoded as two characters.
                3-CHARACTER-CRC-CCITT
                        A 16-bit CCITT-format Cyclic Redundancy Check, encoded
                        as 3 characters.

        BUFFER-SIZE value
                This allows you to set a buffer size during transfer of
                data.  On some systems it takes so long that the remote end
                times out while the local system is reading or writing to
                disk.  The size is the number of disk blocks (nominal) and
                can be from 1 (512 bytes) to the maximum value determined by
                how much memory was available to the program on startup.

        COLLISION value
                What to do when a file arrives that has the same name, type
                and version as an existing file.  DISCARD means to discard
                and reject the incoming file.  OVERWRITE means to overwrite
                the existing file.  NEW-VERSION means to write a new version
                of the file.

        DEBUG ON (or OFF)
                Enables/disables displaying of packets on the screen during
                file transfer.  Not performed if the QUIET option has been
                set for the terminal (SET TERMINAL QUIET)

        DEFAULT device:[directory]
                This is the same as the CD command, and allows you to set
                the default device and unit and/or the directory as
                destination of file transfers.  In addition, issuing this
                command causes Kermit-180 to switch to the specified device
                and directory.  The colon must be included in the device
                name, and the directory may be enclosed in brackets.  The
                selected device and directory appear in your Kermit-180
                prompt, for instance

                    Kermit-180 SY0:[USER]>

        DIRECTORY-LISTING LONG (or BRIEF)
                By setting DIRECTORY-LISTING to BRIEF you can get an
                abbreviated listing of your disk drive.  File sizes and
                attributes are not shown, and up to three files are shown on
                a line.  Setting this option LONG will show the size,
                attributes and the creation date of each file. In addition,
                the LONG option will list the free space remaining.

        ESCAPE  Change the escape character for virtual terminal connections.
                Kermit-180 will prompt you for the new escape character, which
                you enter literally.

        FILE-MODE option
                Tells Kermit-180 what kind of file it is sending, so that
                Kermit can correctly determine the end of the file.  SET
                FILE BINARY means to send all the file blocks, including the
                last block in its entirety; SET FILE ASCII is used for text
                files, and transmission stops when the first Control-Z is
                encountered anywhere in the file (this is the CP/M
                convention for marking the end of a text file).

                SET FILE-MODE DEFAULT tells Kermit to attempt to determine the
                file type by examining the file being transmitted.  If a
                Control-Z appears before the last block of the file, it is
                assumed to be BINARY; if, when the first Control-Z is
                encountered, the remainder of the file contains only
                control-Z's, it is assumed to be a text file.  Unfortunately,
                not all programs fill the remainder of the last record of a
                text file with Control-Z's, so this algorithm is not always
                successful.

                If ASCII transmission is used on a binary file, any 8th bits
                set will be stripped and a warning sent to the console.  When
                the first control-Z is encountered, the file is assumed to be
                at the end, even if it is not.

        FLOW-CONTROL ON (or OFF)
                Sets XON/XOFF flow control on or off.  If set ON the host is
                expected to respond to an XOFF or XON sent by Kermit-180.  If
                set off, no flow control is assumed and any XON/XOFF is
                ignored.

        IBM ON (or OFF)
                Allow the transfer of files to and from an IBM mainframe
                computer.  This makes Kermit-180 wait for the IBM turnaround
                character (XON), ignore parity on input, add appropriate
                parity to output, and use local echoing during CONNECT.  As
                distributed, Kermit-180 uses MARK parity for IBM
                communication.  If you don't give this command, IBM mode is
                OFF.  Since IBM VM/CMS Kermit does not have timeout
                capability, SET IBM ON also turns on the Kermi-180 timer
                automatically.

        LINE portname
                This is the same as the SET PORT command, and allows you to
                switch between different communication ports.  Normally, you
                can connect to any free terminal device.

        LOCAL-ECHO ON (or OFF)
                When you CONNECT to a remote host, you must set LOCAL-ECHO ON
                if the host is half duplex, OFF if full duplex.  OFF by
                default.

        LOGGING ON (or OFF)
                Cease or resume logging whenever connect mode is entered.  This
                is really only applicable after a LOG command is no longer
                required.

        NO-EXIT This command is applicable only for Kermit initiated with a
                command tail.  For example, if Kermit was initiated by:

                KERMIT SEND HELLO;NO-EXIT

                Kermit would first seek out and execute the KERMIT.INI file
                (if present), then send file HELLO to a remote system. 
                Usually Kermit would exit back to the system, but NO-EXIT
                over-rides this.  STAY is a synonym for NO-EXIT.

        PARITY option
                Sets parity for outgoing characters to one of the following:
                NONE, SPACE, MARK, EVEN, or ODD.  On input, if parity is NONE,
                then the 8th bit is kept (as data), otherwise it is stripped
                and ignored.  The parity setting applies to both terminal
                connection and file transfer.  If you set parity to anything
                other than none, Kermit-180 will attempt to use "8th bit
                prefixing" to transfer binary files.  If the other Kermit is
                also capable of 8th bit prefixing, then binary files can be
                transferred successfully; if not, the 8th bit of each data byte
                will be lost (you will see a warning on your screen if this
                happens).

        PORT portname
                This is the same as the SET LINE command, and allows you to
                switch between different communication ports.  Normally, you
                can connect to any free terminal device.

        PRINTER ON (or OFF)
                Turns copying of CONNECT session to printer on and off.  It is
                also possible to toggle the printer on/off from the connect
                state, by typing <escape character> followed by P.

        RECEIVE parameter [value]
                Set a RECEIVE parameter.

                PAD-CHAR
                        Set the PAD character to use while receiving files.
                        Currently a dummy, as for SET SEND PAD-CHAR.
                PADDING [value]
                        Set the number of PAD characters to use while receiving
                        files.  Same as SET SEND PADDING.
                START-OF-PACKET [value]
                        Set the default start of Packet character for receiving
                        files.  Apply the same rules and considerations as for
                        SET SEND START-OF-PACKET.
                PACKET-LENGTH number
                        Tell the other Kermit the longest packet length CP/M
                        Kermit is willing to receive during file transfer.  The
                        maximum length is 94, which is also the default length.

        SEND parameter [value]
                Set a SEND parameter.

                PAD-CHAR
                        Set the Pad character to be used while sending files.
                        It is currently a dummy entry, and does not do
                        anything.
                PADDING [value]
                        Set the number of PAD-CHARS to be used while sending
                        files.  This too does nothing.
                START-OF-PACKET
                        Set the default start of packet character to another
                        character than control-A.  This may be necessary on
                        systems (including intervening networks) that trap
                        control-A characters.  Choose a control character not
                        otherwise used, ie not carriage return (13D, 0DH), line
                        feed (10D, 0AH), tabs (09D, 09H), backspace (08H), and
                        bell (07H) or any other used between you and your
                        remote system.

        SPEED value
                Change the baud rate of the communications port.  This
                command only works if supported by the terminal driver. 
                value is the numeric baud rate (300, 9600, etc.) desired. 
                Type SET SPEED followed by a question mark for a list of
                supported baud rates.

        TACTRAP Set the TAC intercept character.  If you are attached to a TAC
                it will swallow the intercept character (commercial AT sign by
                default) so Kermit sends it twice.  With this command you can
                set the intercept character (ie the one to send twice) to
                another character.

        TERMINAL option
                Select one of the following terminal characteristics:

                OFF     sets emulation off, and its up to the attached terminal
                        to respond to escape sequences sent from the remote
                        host system.

                DUMB    Like off, but carriage return and line feed characters
                        are the only control characters accepted.  All other
                        control characters are simply ignored. (Really a "Glass
                        TTY").

                EXTERNAL
                        Emulation is provided for by a routine in the system
                        dependent part of Kermit.  Attempting to set this
                        option without having and externally supplied routine
                        will return a "Not Implemented" error.

                OFF     All characters are passed directly to the terminal
                        without any interpretation by Kermit.

                VT52    When connected as a terminal to a foreign host, the
                        micro emulates a VT52.  VT52 emulation is set by
                        default, except on micros that already have terminal
                        functionality built in, such as the DEC VT180 and
                        DECmate (these act as VT100-series terminals).

                QUIET   Do not display any file transfer information onto the
                        console.  This mode is useful if you console takes a
                        long time to update the display.  Only the file name is
                        displayed.  DEBUGging information is not displayed even
                        if selected.

                REGULAR Inverse of QUIET.  All packets etc displayed, as
                        usual.

        TIMER ON (or OFF)

                Enable or disable the timer.  The timer is off by default,
                because in the normal case Kermit-180 is communicating with
                a mainframe Kermit that has its own timer.  Mainframe Kermit
                timers tend to be more precise or adaptable to changing
                conditions.  You should SET TIMER ON if you are communicating
                with a Kermit that does not have a timer.  You should SET TIMER
                OFF if you are communicating over a network with long delays.

        WARNING ON (or OFF)
                Warn user of filename conflicts when receiving files from
                remote host, and attempt to generate a unique name by adding
                "&" characters to the given name.  ON by default, which is
                equivalent to SET COLLISION RENAME.

SHOW    Display all settable parameters.  You will get a page or so of the
        status and all parameters that can be set using the SET command.

STATUS  The same function as Show.

STAY    Equivalent to SET NO-EXIT.

TAKE filespec
        Take characters and commands from the specified file as if they were
        entered from the keyboard.  This is useful if you want to set up a
        batch job.  A command file can send, get, receive, set functions etc
        automatically.  A TAKE command can be interrupted with ^C.

        An automatic "TAKE KERMIT.INI" is executed from the default drive when
        Kermit-180 is loaded.  This can be used to set defaults of band rate,
        parity, filetype, default drive etc.

        If KERMIT.INI does not exist, control is given directly to the user.

TRANSMIT filespec turnaround
        Send the specified file to the system on the other end of the
        connection as though it were being typed at the terminal, one line
        at a time.  Each line sent is terminated with a carriage return, and
        any line feeds are stripped from the file sent.  After each line has
        been sent Kermit waits for a character string from the host (eg a
        carriage return).  If not specified, a carriage return is assumed. 
        No Kermit protocol is involved.  An asterisk (star) is sent to the
        console for every line sent, to indicate how the transfer is
        progressing.  This is useful for sending files to systems that don't
        have a Kermit program.  During transmission, you may type one of
        these single-character commands:

        Control-C
            Cease transmission, and drop into terminal emulation mode.
        CR  (carriage return) Re-transmit the previous line.

TYPE filespec
        Type a local file or files on your screen.  A Ctrl-C will cancel the
        command and return to the Kermit prompt.  A Ctrl-X will cancel the
        current file and go on to the next one, if any.  Typing Ctrl-S while
        the file is being displayed will suspend the output, typing Ctrl-Q
        will resume output.

VERSION Show the name, edit number, and edit date of several of the modules
        that make up Kermit-180.


3.1. Assembling Kermit-180 from the sources

Kermit-180 is built in from the following files:

  KDEF.INC    Definitions for KERMIT
  KMIT.MAC    Initialization, main loop, miscellaneous commands (BYE, EXIT,
              LOG, PAUSE, HELP and TAKE)
  KCOM.MAC    Second part of commands (SET and SHOW).
  KPKT.MAC    KERMIT protocol handler (SEND, RECEIVE, LOGOUT, and FINISH
              commands)
  KREM.MAC    REMOTE routines
  KSER.MAC    SERVER routines
  KTT.MAC     The transparent commands (TRANSMIT, CONNECT)
  KCMD.MAC    The command parser
  KSYS.MAC    RSX180/280-specific routines and local file handling commands
              (DIR, ERA, USER, TYPE, PRINT, COPY)
  KUTL.MAC    Utility routines and data
  KDAT.MAC    Global data space

Unlike Kermit-80, there are no customizable system-dependent files since all
the communication is done via the system device drivers, and RSX180/280 
programs are not allowed to access I/O ports directly anyway.

There is a jump entry in the KSYS.MAC file to allow users to add their own
terminal emulator (a leftover of Kermit-80).  If you write the code for such
an emulator, you must load this jump address with the address of your
emulator, and SET TERMINAL EXTERNAL from within Kermit.  All characters will
be passed to this routine during connect mode.

The files are assembled separately with ZSM4 and the resulting relocatable
object files combined into the final task image file with the TKB linker. 
The provided BUILD.CMD command file automates the build steps under RSX180
or RSX280.  Note that you will still need the system include files and the
standard SYSLIB library, which are normally found in the [SYSTEM] directory
of the OS distribution. If they are in another directory then you will have
to edit the BUILD.CMD file accordingly.

If you are doing the development system on an PC, then you can assemble the
files using a CP/M emulator such as John Elliott's ZXCC and the supplied
Makefile.  You can transfer later on your assembled files to the target
system using the vol180 utility supplied with the RSX180 or RSX280
development tree.

Note that the current version of Kermit-180 is built by default as a
privileged task since it needs to set the characteristics of the terminal
used for communications to slave with echo disabled, and those are
privileged operations for terminals other than the user's current one.  This
has the undesirable side effect that Kermit-180 can access any file in the
system, and in any directory, regardless of the current user privileges. 
That is not a problem as long as Kermit-180 is not INStalled, since only
privileged users can run a privileged task.


4.1. Future Work

Work that needs to be done in future releases includes:

 - Addition of missing features, e.g. compression of repeated characters
   during packet transmission, transmission of file attributes (particularly
   size, so that "percent done" can be displayed for both incoming and
   outbound files)

 - Command macros, more advanced login scripts

 - Implement more Server commands

 - etc.
